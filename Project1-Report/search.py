        We can again make use of our generic search algorithm, except that in case of UCS, our data structure will be a priority queue.
        Since, we need to select the lowest cost node in each iteration, we need a min-heap data structure.
        
        Util.PriorityQueue is a min-heap. But, it requires us to explicitly push the priority in the push function. Thus, it won't be useful
        as we have already made use of a generic push function in our general search function.
        
        To avoid re-writing the entire logic again, we can make use of Util.PriorityQueueWithFunction, where we can pass a function reference to
        calculate the priority for each element, whenever we push an element to the heap.
